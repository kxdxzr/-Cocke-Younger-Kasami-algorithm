# Cocke-Younger-Kasami-algorithm

## Membership mode
Input: membership followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form followed by a sequence of input strings.
Output: One line per input string, giving the string, a comma, and then 1 if the string is generated by the grammar and 0 otherwise.

## Rightmost-derivation mode
Input: rightmost-derivation followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal-form followed by an input string that is generated by the context-free grammar.
Output: A sequence of lines, each line containing the next step of a rightmost derivation of the input string.

## Ambiguous mode
Input: ambiguous followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal- form followed by a sequence of input strings.
Output: One line per input string, giving the string, a comma, and then 1 if the string is ambiguous and 0 otherwise.
