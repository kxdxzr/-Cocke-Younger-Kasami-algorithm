## Input format
1. A comma separated list of variable symbols  
2. A comma separated list of terminal symbols  
3. The start variable  
4. One or more lines of the form:  
    A -> B C  
    A -> a  
    A -> epsilon  
5. the string “end”

## Membership mode
Input: membership followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form followed by a sequence of input strings.  
Output: One line per input string, giving the string, a comma, and then 1 if the string is generated by the grammar and 0 otherwise.

## Rightmost-derivation mode
Input: rightmost-derivation followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal-form followed by an input string that is generated by the context-free grammar.  
Output: A sequence of lines, each line containing the next step of a rightmost derivation of the input string.

## Ambiguous mode
Input: ambiguous followed by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal- form followed by a sequence of input strings.  
Output: One line per input string, giving the string, a comma, and then 1 if the string is ambiguous and 0 otherwise.
